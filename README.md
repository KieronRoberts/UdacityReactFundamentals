## Overview

This repository contains the program which i built in order to achieve the Udacity React Fundamentals course. This was my first introduction to React and completing this course was very engaging and allowed me to learn a lot. 

"MyReads" allows users to search for books from a provided API and organize them into three predefined shelves: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Read." Users can easily move books between shelves or remove them altogether.

The project encourages the use of React's component-based architecture, state management, and lifecycle methods to create a responsive and interactive user interface. It emphasises the principles of code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Throughout this project I had the opportunity to practice key React.js concepts such as creating functional and class components, managing state and props, handling user interactions, and implementing routing for multiple app views.

## Skills Learned

As this project was part of the assements in the [Udacity React Fundaments](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) I learnt everything I currently know about React whilst completing this project. However through my studies I beleive the key aspects of react that i learnt were: 

- Rendering UI with React: I learnt how to use create-react-app to create a new React application, how to create reusable React components and how to utilse JSX. 
- State Management: I learnt the importance of state management, how to use props to pass data into components, how to add state to components and how to use useState to update components state.
- Hooks: I learnt was is meant by the components lifecycle, how Hooks enable state and lifecycle in functional components.
- React Router: I learnt how to use React Router to add different routes to applications, how to use state to dynamically render a different â€œpage" and how to use React Router's Route and Link components.
